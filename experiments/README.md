# Week 13

**Theme:** Quantum Computing for Social Data (Intro)

## Goals
- Learn basics of qubits/circuits and what 'speedup' does/doesn’t mean.
- Implement a simple quantum workflow (simulation/circuits).
- Connect quantum examples to social-science data tasks conceptually.

## Materials
- demo/ — in-class demo code (if present)
- Use /data/raw, /data/intermediate, /data/processed for datasets and outputs
- Environment/setup notes live in /environment

## Readings
- TBD (add 2 articles that use this week's technique)
- TBD

## Assignment
- TBD

## Notes
